# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview:

The purpose of this analysis is to aggregate the provided Amazon Vine purchase review data, validate whether the review was part of the Vine program in order to determine how much (if any) these paid review program affect the overall reviews.

## Results:

Of the total number of reviews (3,514,942), there were:
  - 3,508,784 unpaid reviews (99.82%)
  - 5,925 paid reviews (0.18%)  
  - Of the paid vine reviews, 2743 were 5 star reviews, representing 46.29% of the total vine reviews
  - There were a total of 2,300,587 non vine, 5 star reviews, representing 65.45% of the total reviews

## Summary

There does not seem to be a bias towards more favorable review when the product has been paid for by the vine program, as seen when you compare the percentage of 5 star reviews.  Paid reviews returned 46.29% 5 star reviews, whereas non-paid returned a higher percentage of 65.45% 5 star reviews.  An additional peice of analysis that we could look at would be to determine if unverified purchases play a role in the 5 star unpaid reviews, as there are 162,243 reviews that cannot be verified.  This could potentially indicate the use of bots create fake reviews.
